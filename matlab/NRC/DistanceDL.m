% function dist=DistanceDL(a,b,W,verbose)
% Compute the weighted Damerau-Levenshtein distance between two strings; {W.D,W.I,W.S,W.E}
% are the weights on Deletion, Insertion, Substitution, and Exchange (of adjacent symbols
% only), all taken as 1 by default.  Implements Algorithm S of Lowrance & Wagner (1975).

  % When the code gets here, DA(c) holds either 0 or the largest index I, with 1<I<i, such
  % that a(I)=c for each member c of Alphabet; in particular, i1 holds the largest index
  % I, with 1<I<i, such that a(I)=b(j).  Similarly, j1 holds either 0 or the largest
  % index J, with 1<J<j, such that b(J)=a(i).  Knowledge of i1 & j1 enables "Operation *":
  %  1) start from the first i1 symbols of a, modified to match the first j1 symbols of b;
  %  2) Delete those elements corresponding to the elements between i1 and i in a;
  %  3) Exchange the element corresponding to i1 in a with the (new) element to its right;
  %  4) Insert the appropriate symbols to match the elements between j1 and j in b.
